# Crime-Weather

The relationship between weather patterns and crime rates is well-documented and researched. Abundant literature has found positive associations between temperature and crime, as well as sharp decreases in crime due to anomalous weather events. To date, no study has reviewed intra-day associations between weather features and crime rates for New York City. In our study, we review 5.5 million reported crime incidents in New York City and associate them with the weather in which they occurred. We find a strong correlation (R-squared = 0.94) between temperature and the seven major felonies. Correlation between temperature and crime is generally strongest for felony assault, grand larceny, and grand larceny of a motor vehicle. Correlations with visibility, wind speed, air pressure, precipitation, and cloud cover are found to be weaker. We find a moderately strong and persistent correlation between southerly wind bearing and the seven major felonies that we cannot credibly explain. We explore weather pattern and crime associations at the precinct level and find them to be present but consistently weaker. Finally, we discuss how these findings may be applied to policing or monitoring efforts in New York City.
